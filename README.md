# 01-RTC-landingResponsive

Project developed with HTML and CSS.

This project is the first of the Rock{TheCode} programme. This project is about making a responsive landing page. In my case I have chosen the website of a festival that takes place in my city and I have adjusted it to my own taste.

Original web: https://iconicafest.com/
